# Stellar Client

The Stellar client is an AngularJS application that allows users to interact with the Stellar network from their browser.
This client allows users to register for an account, generate a wallet containing cryptographic keys, and submit transactions to the Stellar network.

You can see it in action here: https://launch.stellar.org

## Security

Encrypting secret data:
 - Secret keys are encrypted in the browser before storing them in a [stellar-wallet](https://github.com/stellar/stellar-wallet) server.
 - Wallets are encrypted using 256bit AES in GCM mode.
 - The key used to encrypt/decrypt a wallet is derived from a username and password using [scrypt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrypt).

Signing transactions:
 - Transactions are signed using the [Ed25519 signature system](http://ed25519.cr.yp.to/) implemented in [tweetnacl](http://tweetnacl.cr.yp.to/).
 - Signing keys are generated randomly during registration.
 - Transactions are signed in the browser before submitting them to a [stellard](https://github.com/stellar/stellard) server.
